# üèõ High Performance Software Foundation Policy Repo

This repo contains documents related to the operation of the
[High Performance Software Foundation](https://hpsf.io) (HPSF).

HPSF launched on May 13, 2024 and the Governing Board (GB) will begin
to convene within weeks. Watch this space for further developments.

## Governance

* [HPSF charter](charter.md), which contains the base rules under which HPSF operates.
  See in particular:
  * [Membership](charter.md#membership)
    * [Membership levels and fees](charter.md#exhibit-c)
  * [Governing Board](charter.md#governing-board)
  * [Technical Advisory Council (TAC)](charter.md#technical-advisory-council)
* [Participation agreement](cncf-membership-agreement.pdf), which members must sign.
* [TAC Governance Repo](http://github.com/hpsfoundation/tac): the TAC maintains its
  own governance, including:
  * A [Project Lifecycle](https://github.com/hpsfoundation/tac/blob/main/lifecycle_policy.md)
    that defines onboarding and procedures for projects, and
  * Ongoing [Working Groups](https://github.com/hpsfoundation/tac/tree/main/working-groups)
    that bring together community members for collaboration.
* The Linux Foundation [Code of Conduct](https://lfprojects.org/policies/code-of-conduct/),
  which we use in HPSF. Projects may have their own codes of conduct, as well.
