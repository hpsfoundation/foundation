# High Performance Computing Foundation ("HPSF") Charter

The Linux Foundation

Effective May 12, 2024 / Updated May 12, 2024

## 1. Mission of the High Performance Software Foundation

The Foundation's mission is to constantly improve the quality and open availability of software for High Performance Computing through open collaboration. Through a series of technical projects, HPSF aims to build, promote, and advance a portable core software stack for HPC by increasing adoption, lowering barriers to contribution, and supporting development efforts.

HPC software empowers organizations to run large-scale computational applications on conventional and accelerated systems of any size. From laptops, to HPC clusters, to clouds. HPSF aims to make accelerated computing ubiquitous, and its projects enable systems that run portably across a diverse range of architectures with good performance.

## 2. Role of the HPSF.

The HPSF will serve a role in the open source community responsible for:

-	(a) Stewardship of the projects

	-	i. Ensuring that technologies are available to the community and free of partisan influence

	-	ii. Ensure that the technologies' brands (trademarks and logos) are cared for and used appropriately by members of the community

-	(b) Fostering the growth and evolution of the ecosystem

	-	i. Evaluating which additional technologies should be added to HPSF and working to encourage the community to deliver them, and integrate them if and only if they advance the general agenda

	-   ii. Providing services that ease the task of maintaining and testing HPC projects across platforms

	-	iii. Promoting performance portability over time to take advantage of new hardware developments without sacrificing maintainability

-	(c) Promotion of the underlying technologies including: events and conferences, marketing, training courses and developer certification, and workforce development activities

-   (d) Collaborate with other communities like OpenSSF and CNCF to:

    - i. address supply chain security concerns and promote standard security practices among member projects

    - ii. increase interoperability of HPC and Cloud software

## 3. Values.

The HPSF will strive to adhere to the following principles:

-	(a) Open. The foundation is open and accessible, and operates independently of specific partisan interests. The foundation accepts all contributors based on the merit of their contributions, and the foundation's technology must be available to all according to open source values. The technical community and its decisions shall be transparent.

-	(b) Fair. The foundation will avoid undue influence, bad behavior or "pay-to-play" decision-making.

-   (c) Community stewardship. We believe that ultimately, sustainability of projects comes from a broadly distributed user and contributor base. Projects should strive to broaden adoption and to develop a diverse contributor base.

-   (d) Inclusivity. Broadly successful and useful technologies require different perspectives and skill sets, which can only be heard in a welcoming and respectful environment.

-	(e) Constant evolution. The HPC ecosystem has always been driven by external technology developments and societal needs. As high performance software becomes more prevalent in areas outside of traditional HPC, HPC software must constantly evolve with these trends to continue to grow over time.

-	(f) Platform agnostic. Projects should strive to build software that works and performs well on a diverse range of hardware architectures and platform scales. HPC software is as much used (or more) on laptops and workstations as on the world's largest supercomputers.


## 4. Membership.

The HPSF shall be composed of Premier, General, and Associate (Academic, Non-Profit, and Government) member participants. All member applications will be reviewed by the Linux Foundation, who will decide whether that applicant can be classified as academic/non-profit/government for purposes of HPSF membership.

	-	iii. at least three (3) representatives elected by the End User Participants at large. The number of at large End User Participant representatives shall generally be three (3), but may be increased either (A) by vote of the then-existing End User TAB or (B) automatically to the extent necessary to ensure the minimum size described in section 8(a) of this charter is met (given the number of Platinum, Gold, and Silver End User member representatives).

	-	iv. one (1) to two (2) TAC members designated by the TAC, each of whom must be employed by an End User Participant.

	-	v. one (1) or more additional End User Participant representatives may be invited to serve on the End User TAB if approved by a majority of the then-existing members of the End User TAB.						

-	(c) Terms: Each elected or invited member of the End User TAB shall serve a term of approximately two (2) years, except that approximately half of the elected members of the End User TAB resulting from the first election shall serve a one (1) year term in order to facilitate staggered terms. The initial End User TAB shall determine which of the initial members shall serve a one (1) year term and which shall serve a two (2) year term.

-	(d) Termination: An End User TAB member's participation shall cease before the expiration of their term if they resign, are removed, or they cease to be employed by the End User organization that employed them at the time they were elected. There are no limits on the number of terms that an individual can serve. The End User TAB may, by supermajority vote of at least two-thirds of the End User TAB members who do not have conflicts of interest, remove an End User TAB member who is not fulfilling their duties or is not complying with the policies of CNCF or the End User TAB.

-	(e) Vacancies: In the event of a vacancy due to an End User TAB member's employer ceasing to be an End User Participant, the End User TAB shall decide when to fill the vacancy and whether to fill the vacancy by election or invitation. In the event of a vacancy due to to an individual's resignation, removal, or changing employers, the End User Participant that employed such individual at the time they were elected may designate a replacement. For the sake of continuity, in the event an individual serving on the End User TAB leaves their employer for another employer who is also an End User Participant, the remaining non-conflicted End User TAB members may, by majority vote, increase the size of the End User TAB and invite the individual to remain on the End User TAB for a duration no longer than their original term; such individual continuing to serve shall be in addition to (not in lieu of) the individual's prior employer's right to designate a replacement.

-	(f) Alternates: Any End User Participant with an employee serving on the End User TAB may designate an alternate who may (a) attend meetings in listen-only mode when the primary representative is present and (b) speak and vote at meetings when the primary representative is not present.
