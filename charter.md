# The High Performance Software Foundation Charter

**The Linux Foundation**
**Effective May 13, 2024**

## Mission and Scope of the High Performance Software Foundation

The mission of the High Performance Software Foundation (the "Directed Fund") is to
constantly improve the quality and open availability of software for High Performance
Computing through open collaboration. HPC software empowers organizations to run
large-scale computational applications on conventional and accelerated systems of any
size. From laptops, to HPC clusters, to clouds. HPSF aims to make accelerated computing
ubiquitous, and its projects enable systems that run portably across a diverse range of
architectures with good performance.

Through a series of open technical projects (each such project, a "Technical Project"),
HPSF aims to build, promote, and advance a portable core software stack for HPC by
increasing adoption, lowering barriers to contribution, and supporting development
efforts. The governance of each Technical Project is as set forth in the applicable
charter for each Technical Project.

The Directed Fund supports the Technical Projects. The Directed Fund operates under the
guidance of the Governing Board of the Directed Fund (the "Governing Board") and The
Linux Foundation (the "LF") as may be consistent with The Linux Foundationâ€™s tax-exempt
status. The Governing Board manages the Directed Fund. The Directed Fund will also have
an Outreach Committee, Government Advisory Committee, a Technical Advisory Council, and
other working groups, councils, committees and similar bodies (collectively,
"Committees") that may be established by the Governing Board. These committees report to
the Governing Board.

## Membership

The Directed Fund will be composed of Premier, General and Associate Members (each, a
"Member" and, collectively, the "Members") in Good Standing. All Members must be current
corporate members of the LF (at any level) to participate in the Directed Fund as a
member. All participants in the Directed Fund, enjoy the privileges and undertake the
obligations described in this Charter, as from time to time amended by the Governing
Board with the approval of the LF. During the term of their membership, all members will
comply with all such policies as the LF Board of Directors and/or the Directed Fund may
adopt with notice to members.

Premier Members will be entitled to appoint a representative to the Governing Board and
any Committee. The General Members will be represented on the Governing Board by one
representative to the Governing Board for every five General Members, up to a maximum of
25% of the Governing Board members, provided that there will always be at least one
General Member representative, even if there are less than five General Members. Each
General Member can nominate one representative, and participates in the election process
determined by the Governing Board.

The Associate Member category of membership is limited to Associate Members of The Linux
Foundation. The Governing Board may set additional criteria for joining the Directed
Fund as an Associate Member. If the Associate Member is a membership organization,
Associate Membership in the Directed Fund does not confer any benefits or rights to the
members of the Associate Member.

Members will be entitled to:
- participate in Directed Fund general meetings, initiatives, events and any other
  activities; and
- identify themselves as members of the High Performance Software Foundation supporting
  the High Performance Software Foundation community.

## Governing Board

The Governing Board voting members will consist of:
- one representative appointed by each Premier Member;
- the TAC Representatives (as defined herein); and
- the elected General Member representative or representatives.

Only one Member that is part of a group of Related Companies (as defined in Section 7)
may appoint, or nominate for a membership class election, a representative on the
Governing Board. No single Member, company or set of Related Companies will be entitled
to: (i) appoint or nominate for Membership class election more than one representative
for the Governing Board, or (ii) have more than two representatives on the Governing
Board.

Please note that it will be acceptable for one Member to appoint or nominate a
representative to the Governing Board and have another of its employees, or an employee
of one of its Related Companies, serve as a TAC Representative on the Governing Board.

## Conduct of Meetings

Governing Board meetings will be limited to the Governing Board representatives, the
Outreach Committee Chair, invited guests and LF staff. Governing Board meetings follow
the requirements for quorum and voting outlined in this Charter. The Governing Board may
decide whether to allow named representatives (one per Member per Governing Board and
per Committee) to attend as an alternate.

The Governing Board meetings will be private unless decided otherwise by the Governing
Board. The Governing Board may invite guests to participate in consideration of specific
Governing Board topics (but such guest may not participate in any vote on any matter
before the Governing Board).

## Officers

The officers ("Officers") of the Directed Fund as of the first meeting of the Governing
Board will be a Chairperson ("Chair") and a Treasurer. Additional Officer positions may
be created by the Governing Board. The Chair must be a voting member of the Governing
Board.

The Chair will preside over meetings of the Governing Board, manage any day-to-day
operational decisions, and will submit minutes for Governing Board approval.

The Treasurer will assist in the preparation of budgets for Governing Board approval,
monitor expenses against the budget and authorize expenditures approved in the budget.

The Governing Board will be responsible for overall management of the Directed Fund,
including:

- approve a budget directing the use of funds raised by the Directed Fund from all
  sources of revenue;
- nominate and elect Officers of the Directed Fund;
- approve, in addition to TAC approval, projects as Technical Projects;
- oversee all Directed Fund business and community outreach matters and work with the LF
  on any legal matters that arise;
- adopt and maintain policies or rules and procedures for the Directed Fund (subject to
  LF approval);
- establish advisory bodies, committees, programs or councils to resolve any particular
  matter or in support of the mission of the Directed Fund and/or its Technical Projects
  including in support of end-users and ambassadors for the project;
- request and approve conformance programs proposed by the TAC and solicit input
  (including testing tools) from the applicable governance body of any Technical Project
  for defining and administering any programs related to conformance with any Technical
  Project (each, a "Conformance Program");
- publish use cases, user stories, websites and priorities to help inform the ecosystem
  and technical community;
- approve procedures for the nomination and election of any representative of the
  General Members to the Governing Board and any Officer or other positions created by
  the Governing Board; and
- vote on all decisions or matters coming before the Governing Board.

## Committees

### Outreach Committee

The Outreach Committee will include one appointed voting representative from each
Premier Member. Each General Member may appoint a non-voting representative to observe
and contribute ideas to the Outreach Committee.

The Outreach Committee will be responsible for the design, development and execution of
community outreach efforts on behalf of the Governing Board. The Outreach Committee is
expected to coordinate closely with the Governing Board and technical communities to
maximize the outreach and visibility of the Technical Project throughout the industry.

The Governing Board may appoint a chairperson of the Outreach Committee or delegate
responsibility for selecting a chairperson to the Outreach Committee. The Outreach
Committee chairperson will be responsible for reporting progress back to the Governing
Board. The Outreach Committee chairperson may attend meetings of the Governing Board,
but, unless the Outreach Committee chairperson is a member of the Governing Board, the
Outreach Committee chairperson will not attend as a voting member of the Governing
Board.

### Government Advisory Committee

The Governing Board may stand up a Government Advisory Committee (the "GAC") in order to
provide the Directed Fund with advice from government entities approved to participate
by the Governing Board. Members of the GAC must be national governments, multinational
governmental organizations and treaty organizations, or public authorities. Each GAC
member may appoint one representative to attend meetings of the GAC. There are no fees
to participate in the GAC. The Governing Board may appoint a chairperson or other person
to report to the Governing Board on progress of the GAC.

## Technical Advisory Council

The role of the TAC is to facilitate communication and collaboration among the Technical
Projects. The TAC will be responsible for:
- coordinating collaboration among Technical Projects, including development of an
  overall technical vision for the community;
- making recommendations to the Budget Committee of resource priorities for Technical
  Projects;
- electing annually a chairperson to preside over meetings, set the agenda for meetings,
  ensure meeting minutes are taken and who will also serve on the Governing Board as a
  TAC representative;
- electing additional TAC representatives to serve on the governing board from the
  voting members of the TAC appointed by TAC Projects; one representative is elected for
  every five Technical Projects represented on the TAC, but no more than 25% (including
  the TAC chair) of the total members of the Governing Board;
- creating, maintaining and amending project lifecycle procedures and processes, subject
  to the approval of the Governing Board; and
- such other matters related to the
  technical role of the TAC as may be communicated to the TAC by the Governing Board.

The voting members of the TAC consist of:
- one representative appointed by each Premier Member; and
- one representative appointed by the technical oversight body (e.g., a technical
  steering committee) of each TAC Project (as defined herein).

One representative of any Member may observe meetings of the TAC. Any committers from a
TAC Project may observe meetings of the TAC. The TAC may change this at any point in
time, including: (a) opening meetings to a broader community; (b) holding closed
meetings; and (c) holding meetings open to the public.

At the start of the Directed Fund, "TAC Projects" are those Technical Projects listed as
having voting representatives on the TAC on the Directed Fundâ€™s web site. Thereafter,
any Technical Project can become a TAC Project through the approval of the Technical
Projectâ€™s technical oversight body, the TAC (by a two-thirdâ€™s vote), and the Governing
Board. The TAC and the Governing Board will approve a project lifecycle policy that will
address the incubation, archival and other stages of Technical Projects, as well as the
criteria for a Technical Project to qualify as a TAC Project.

The TAC representatives will elect a chair to preside over meetings, ensure minutes are
taken and drive the TAC agenda with input from the TAC representatives.

## Voting

Quorum for Governing Board and Committee meetings will require at least fifty percent of
the voting representatives. If advance notice of the meeting has been given per normal
means and timing, the Governing Board may continue to meet even if quorum is not met,
but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

Ideally decisions will be made based on consensus. If, however, any decision requires a
vote to move forward, the representatives of the Governing Board or Committee, as
applicable, will vote on a one vote per voting representative basis.

Except as provided in Section 14.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by vote at a
meeting will require a simple majority vote, provided quorum is met. Except as provided
in Section 14.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by electronic vote without a
meeting will require a majority of all voting representatives.

In the event of a tied vote with respect to an action that cannot be resolved by the
Governing Board, the Chair may refer the matter to the LF for assistance in reaching a
decision. If there is a tied vote in any Committee that cannot be resolved, the matter
may be referred to the Governing Board.

## Subsidiaries and Related Companies

### Definitions:
- **"Subsidiaries"** means any entity in which a Member owns, directly or indirectly,
  more than fifty percent of the voting securities or membership interests of the entity
  in question;
- **"Related Company"** means any entity which controls or is controlled by a Member or
  which, together with a Member, is under the common control of a third party, in each
  case where such control results from ownership, either directly or indirectly, of more
  than fifty percent of the voting securities or membership interests of the entity in
  question; and
- **"Related Companies"** are entities that are each a Related Company of a Member.

Only the legal entity which has executed a Participation Agreement and its Subsidiaries
will be entitled to enjoy the rights and privileges of such Membership; provided,
however, that such Member and its Subsidiaries will be treated together as a single
Member.

If a Member is itself a foundation, association, consortium, open source project,
membership organization, user group or other entity that has members or sponsors, then
the rights and privileges granted to such Member will extend only to the
employee-representatives of such Member, and not to its members or sponsors, unless
otherwise approved by the Governing Board in a specific case.

Directed Fund Membership is non-transferable, non-salable and non-assignable, except a
Member may transfer its current Membership benefits and obligations to a successor of
substantially all of its business or assets, whether by merger, sale or otherwise;
provided that the transferee agrees to be bound by this Charter and the Bylaws and
policies required by LF membership.

## Good Standing

The Linux Foundationâ€™s Good Standing Policy is available at
[https://www.linuxfoundation.org/good-standing-policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/good-standing-policy)
and will apply to Members of this Directed Fund.

## Trademarks

Any trademarks relating to the Directed Fund or the Technical Project, including without
limitation any mark relating to any Conformance Program, must be transferred to and held
by LF Projects, LLC or the Linux Foundation and available for use pursuant to LF
Projects, LLCâ€™s trademark usage policy, available at
[www.lfprojects.org/trademarks/](www.lfprojects.org/trademarks/).

## Antitrust Guidelines

All Members must abide by The Linux Foundationâ€™s Antitrust Policy available at
[http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy).

All Members must encourage open participation from any organization able to meet the
membership requirements, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the
Governing Board will not seek to exclude any member based on any criteria, requirements
or reasons other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory
basis to all members.

## Budget

The Governing Board will approve an annual budget and never commit to spend in excess of
funds raised. The budget and the purposes to which it is applied must be consistent with
both (a) the non-profit and tax-exempt mission of The Linux Foundation and (b) the
aggregate goals of the Technical Projects.

The Linux Foundation will provide the Governing Board with regular reports of spend
levels against the budget. Under no circumstances will The Linux Foundation have any
expectation or obligation to undertake an action on behalf of the Directed Fund or
otherwise related to the Directed Fund that is not covered in full by funds raised by
the Directed Fund.

In the event an unbudgeted or otherwise unfunded obligation arises related to the
Directed Fund, The Linux Foundation will coordinate with the Governing Board to address
gap funding requirements.

## General & Administrative Expenses

The Linux Foundation will have custody of and final authority over the usage of any
fees, funds and other cash receipts. A General & Administrative (G&A) fee will be
applied by The Linux Foundation to funds raised to cover membership records, finance,
accounting, and human resources operations. The G&A fee will be 9% of the Directed
Fundâ€™s first $1,000,000 of gross receipts each year and 6% of the Directed Fundâ€™s gross
receipts each year over $1,000,000.

## General Rules and Operations

The Directed Fund activities must:
- engage in the work of the project in a professional manner consistent with maintaining
  a cohesive community, while also maintaining the goodwill and esteem of The Linux
  Foundation in the open source community;
- respect the rights of all trademark owners, including any branding and usage
  guidelines;
- engage or coordinate with The Linux Foundation on all outreach, website and marketing
  activities regarding the Directed Fund or on behalf of any Technical Project that
  invoke or associate the name of any Technical Project or The Linux Foundation; and
- operate under such rules and procedures as may be approved by the Governing Board and
  confirmed by The Linux Foundation.
